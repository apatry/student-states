# US State Capitals Study Helper

This is a small program that I created with my son to help him learn
programming and study state capitals. He was the product manager and
came out with the following specs:

- The program starts by asking you which states to study;
- For each state to study:
  - Ask for the capital.
  - If the user entered the right capital then move to the next state;
  - Otherwise, display the answer and ask the same question again

It is simple but we had a lot of fun putting it together. I am adding
it here so that he can share his work and eventually improve it.

Be aware that we only added the states for which he needed to
study. We will onboard new state following his homeworks requirements.
